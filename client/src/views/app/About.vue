        This is created as a personal project and <b>will not</b> be deployed on
        the live network of Ethereum as of yet.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        The purpose of this project is to allow me to learn and practice my
        solidity skills, as well as getting familiar with interacting with the
        blockchain using ethers.js.
      </p>
      <br />

        The project is open source and is available on Github by clicking
