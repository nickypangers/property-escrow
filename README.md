# Property Escrow

### Overview

The purpose of this smart contract is to provide a decentralized alternative for property trading.

By removing middlemen, both sellers and buyers will not be required to pay hefty commissions that normal real estate agents normally will receive.

As per other decentralized solutions, trust is required for trades to happen smoothly. Both buyers and sellers should do their own diligence when transacting using this smart contract.

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
node scripts/sample-script.js
npx hardhat help
```
